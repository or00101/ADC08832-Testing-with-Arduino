# ADC08832-Testing-with-Arduino

This code was meant to be used in order to test the ADC08832 (Analog to Digital Converter IC [Texas Instruments]).

The code will let you focus on the timing graph (Fig 21) seen on page 10 of the IC's datasheet:

> The appropriate pull-down resistors should be of 1kOhms. But this hasn't been tested yet.
